There is a number of ways to contribute to OpenHFT/Chronicle Software.  You need to;

- fork one of the projects,
- try an improvement such as adding documentation, a unit test, or a fix.
- issue a Pull Request.

=== I am not familiar with these projects

A good way to get a feel of these projects is to look at our projects web site

http://chronicle.software/hft-products/[Chronicle Products]


I also suggest you read this blog as it contains more detailed information about using our products in context. My presentation on http://www.slideshare.net/PeterLawrey/low-latency-microservices-in-java-qcon-new-york-2016[Low Latency Microservices] may also help.

Once you have found a product you are interested in, you can read the README for those products

For example if you click http://chronicle.software/products/chronicle-queue/[Chronicle Queue] you can see links on getting started and the documentation on the right.

If you get stuck, you can ask questions on our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/java-chronicle[Google Group] and if you find a issue, please let us know via the Issue tab on GitHub for each project.
